          Venus, often called Earth’s sister planet, is one of the most
          mysterious and hostile worlds in our solar system. Though similar in
          size and composition to Earth, Venus has evolved along a drastically
          different path. Its thick atmosphere, filled with carbon dioxide and
          clouds of sulfuric acid, traps heat so effectively that its surface is
          hotter than Mercury’s, despite being farther from the Sun.
          <br /><br />The planet rotates so slowly that a single Venusian day
          lasts longer than its year, and its surface pressure is strong enough
          to crush metal. Ancient astronomers, captivated by its brilliant glow
          in the morning and evening skies, named it after the Roman goddess of
          love and beauty. But this glowing “evening star” is more deceptive
          than divine.

        Venus has destroyed nearly every probe humanity has sent to its surface,
        and its environment—volcanic, acidic, and potentially still geologically
        active—makes it one of the most dangerous places in the solar system.
        Curiously, the name “Venus” has also drawn comparisons to the Venus
        flytrap, the carnivorous plant that lures insects with its bright,
        inviting appearance before snapping shut to digest them. While the
        planet and the plant are unrelated, the metaphor is a striking one: both
        are natural wonders that conceal danger behind beauty. Venus, the
        planet, gleams seductively from afar, but punishes curiosity with
        crushing pressure, toxic air, and unbearable heat.
        <br /><br />Some suggest that this symbolic resemblance—deadly
        allure—may have even contributed to the shared name in folklore, as both
        represent the idea that appearances can mislead. In this light, Venus is
        not just the goddess of love, but a cosmic symbol of duality: enchanting
        yet hostile, beautiful yet brutal. Its name, rooted in mythology, has
        taken on new meaning in science—one that blends ancient symbolism with
        modern revelation.
